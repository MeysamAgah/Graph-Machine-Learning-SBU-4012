# Assignment #1
This assignment consist of 2 parts : <br />
first part is about my score in **scientific computing with python** <br />
At second part I completed numpy , pandas and matplot tasks in **Labex** <br />
## Part 1   <br />
As you see I completed 31 tasks out of 56 (please open pic to see my score) <br/> ![This is an image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113939902/218981270-85c1be01-a06f-4516-b1bc-6cd486e87c91.png) <br />
## Part 2  <br />
I completed 60 out of 100 challenges of [Numpy](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Graph-Machine-Learning-SBU-4012/blob/main/Assignments%20and%20Homeworks/Assignment%20%231/numpy.ipynb) <br />
I completed 60 out of 100 challenges of [Pandas](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Graph-Machine-Learning-SBU-4012/blob/main/Assignments%20and%20Homeworks/Assignment%20%231/pandas.ipynb) <br />
I completed all challenges of [matplot](https://github.com/MeysamAgah/Graph-Machine-Learning-SBU-4012/blob/main/Assignments%20and%20Homeworks/Assignment%20%231/matplotlib.ipynb) <br />
**Note:** <br />
The rest of 40 challenges of Numpy and Pandas will be completed soon. <br />
I changed some parameters and variables name of code in my own attempts in order to learn how they work. <br />
**Thanks**
